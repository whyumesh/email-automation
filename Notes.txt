Perfect 👍 Since you’re taking over this project, let me explain it like a handover note so you clearly understand what it does, how it’s structured, and where you’ll likely work.

🔹 Project Overview

This project automates sample request status reporting across different management levels in Abbott:

TBMs (Territory Business Managers) → Get their own requests

ABMs (Area Business Managers) → Get reports of all TBMs under them

ZBMs/Marketing Heads → Get consolidated division/affiliate-level reports


The system:

1. Reads master data files (Excel/CSV).


2. Cleans & formats them (dates, missing values).


3. Creates pivot tables & summaries.


4. Generates Excel attachments where needed.


5. Uses HTML email templates (via Jinja2) for professional formatting.


6. Sends emails via Outlook (win32com.client).

🔹 Scripts & Their Roles

1. Email_Automation_V4.py

Audience: TBMs

Logic:

Groups data by Input Sample Request: Created Alias (the TBM code).

Prepares row-wise details (doctor, SKU, qty, dispatch, delivery, transporter, etc.).

Renders email_template_V4.html.

Sends email to TBM (one per TBM).


No Excel attachment, just HTML body.



---

2. Email_Automation_V4 - ABM.py

Audience: ABMs (+ ZBMs CC’d)

Logic:

Groups data by ABM Emp Code.

Creates Excel file for each ABM containing TBM-level requests.

Sends email:

To = ABM

CC = ZBM (if available)

Attachment = Excel file


Uses email_template_ABM_V4.html (but mostly just body + attachment).




---

3. email_template_MARKETING_V2.py

Audience: Marketing Heads / Division Heads

Logic:

Builds pivot tables at division level.

Calculates counts of requests by status:

Dispatched, Pending, In-Transit, Delivered, Out of stock, Returned, Incomplete address, Doctor refused, etc.


Generates division-wise Excel summary files.

Uses email_template_MARKETING - Tabular.html to render summary tables inside email.

Sends email:

To = Division heads (from Affiliate wise Email I’D.xlsx)

CC/BCC = fixed addresses (corporate team).

Attachment = division Excel report.

🔹 Data Files Involved

Input Data Files

TBM & ABM Automation Email 1209252.xlsx → Source for TBM & ABM scripts

Marketing Head - ( Division Wise) 10092025.csv → Source for Marketing script

Affiliate wise Email I’D.xlsx → Mapping of division codes to email IDs


Email Templates

email_template_V4.html → TBM

email_template_ABM_V4.html → ABM

email_template_MARKETING - Tabular.html → Marketing




---

🔹 Output

TBM emails → HTML body only (individual request details).

ABM emails → Excel attachment + body.

Marketing emails → Division-wise summary in email + Excel attachment.



---

🔹 Tech Stack

Python Libraries:

pandas → data cleaning & grouping

openpyxl + xlsxwriter → Excel file generation

jinja2 → HTML email templates

win32com.client → Outlook automation (sending emails)


Outlook dependency:

Needs to run on a system with MS Outlook installed & configured.

Emails go out as if sent from EPD_SFA@abbott.com.

🔹 As New Owner, What You’ll Do

1. Understand Data Flows

Ensure input files (.xlsx & .csv) are updated correctly by whoever supplies them.

Validate column names (these scripts rely on exact column names).



2. Maintain Templates

If management wants changes in email format → edit .html templates, not Python code.



3. Modify Filters/Logic

If reporting structure changes (new ABM, new division, new affiliate), update mappings in Excel or filters in script.



4. Troubleshoot

If a script fails → check input file path, missing columns, or Outlook connectivity.



5. Automate Execution

Currently manual run. You can later schedule via Windows Task Scheduler or an internal automation tool.





---

✅ Hierarchy Summary:

TBM script → Sends request details to each TBM
ABM script → Sends TBM details (Excel) to each ABM (cc ZBM)
Marketing script → Sends division summary (Excel + email table) to Marketing heads

Would you like me to now create a visual flow diagram (Org-level) that shows who gets what email/report? That will help you present this project easily in meetings.
